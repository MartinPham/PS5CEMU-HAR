# Getting PS5CEMU-HAR running on any firmware and HEN

PS5CEMU-HAR is a homebrew app. It does not jailbreak your console; it runs on top of whatever
jailbreak and HEN you already have, and it is written to work with **any** of them. This page covers
two separate questions:

1. **[Can your PS5 run homebrew at all?](#1-can-your-ps5-run-homebrew)** — this depends on your
   firmware and is decided *before* PS5CEMU-HAR, by the public jailbreak scene.
2. **[Given a console that runs homebrew, how do you get PS5CEMU-HAR going?](#2-what-ps5cemu-har-needs)**
   — this is what the rest of the page is about, for every HEN and config.

After any change, open **Settings > Diagnostics** in the app: its first lines say exactly what the
app got (firmware, HEN, recompiler memory, `/data`). The [Setup check](#the-setup-check) on the
first start shows the same thing with a QR code to this page.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Legal use only.** PS5CEMU-HAR plays games, keys and system files that *you* dump from hardware
> and software you own. It ships none, and this guide is not an invitation to download any. Running
> homebrew needs a modified console, which may void its warranty and breach the platform's terms.
> Use at your own risk.

## 1. Can your PS5 run homebrew?

Whether a PS5 can run *any* homebrew (and therefore PS5CEMU-HAR) is set by its **firmware version**
and by the public exploits that exist for it. This is upstream of this project — we use the scene's
tools, we don't make them — and it **moves quickly**, so treat the table below as a snapshot and
check a current source such as [wololo.net's PS5 jailbreak
page](https://wololo.net/ps5-jailbreak-and-custom-firmware/) before you act on it.

Find your firmware on the console under **Settings > System > System Software > Console Information**
(or the app shows it in **Settings > Diagnostics**).

| Firmware | Can run homebrew? | How (entry point) |
|---|---|---|
| **1.00 – 5.50** | **Yes** | The UMTX kernel exploit (and the IPV6 exploit on some), then a HEN such as etaHEN. |
| **≤ 7.61, disc consoles** | **Yes** | BD-JB (the Blu-ray entry) is an alternative on consoles with a disc drive. |
| **7.00 – 13.60** | **Yes** | The **Relapse** exploit (WebKit + kernel, published Sept 2026), all models including Slim and Pro. Loads a HEN (etaHEN is supported up to 12.70; Kstuff Lite reaches 13.60). |
| **5.51 – 6.99, digital consoles** | **Maybe / gap** | Above UMTX's 5.50 ceiling and below Relapse's 7.00 floor; BD-JB needs a disc drive. Check current sources for your exact version. |
| **14.00 and newer** | **No (today)** | Sony closed the Relapse hole in firmware 14.00 (early Sept 2026). No public entry point yet, and **the PS5 cannot be downgraded**. See [Where it's impossible](#9-where-its-impossible-and-what-we-can-do). |

Two things to keep in mind whatever your firmware:

- **These jailbreaks are tethered.** They don't survive a reboot or a full power-off — after every
  boot you re-run the exploit (open the exploit host page in the console browser, or let your
  BD-JB/USB chain run) and reload your HEN *before* starting PS5CEMU-HAR. Rest mode usually keeps a
  jailbroken state; a cold boot does not.
- **Never update to chase a feature.** If your console is on a jailbreakable firmware, turn off
  automatic updates. There is no official way back down.

**The bottom line for this app:** if your console can load **etaHEN, OnionHEN, or even just an ELF
loader (elfldr) on port 9021**, PS5CEMU-HAR will run. The sections below assume you are at that
point.

## 2. What PS5CEMU-HAR needs

Once a HEN or ELF loader is running, the app needs three things, and it reaches for each of them by
itself:

| Need | Why | How the app gets it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/data` | Settings, saves, games, caches and logs all live in `/data/ps5cemu` | The HEN's app jailbreak, or the bundled `sandbox-elevator.elf` run through elfldr |
| Executable memory | Cemu's and Azahar's recompilers write and run code; without it, Wii U games fall back to the much slower interpreter | The HEN's JIT memory when granted, otherwise executable *direct* memory the app makes itself, which needs no HEN |
| USB and extended drives | Only if your games are there | The bundled `sandbox-elevator.elf` through elfldr, when a game folder or drive is refused |

### What the app does at startup, in order

1. It asks the HEN to jailbreak it, by writing `{"PID":n}` to `/download0/etahen_jailbreak` — the app
   jailbreak request etaHEN and OnionHEN both answer. The HEN only answers for title IDs in its
   allowlist, so **`PPSA99360` has to be listed there.** It waits ~5 s for the HEN to take the
   request and ~3 s more for it to finish.
2. It tests the HEN's JIT memory. If that isn't granted, it makes **executable direct memory**
   itself — no HEN grant needed — and runs a few bytes of real code to prove the kernel allows it.
3. If `/data` is still out of reach, it asks **elfldr** (port 9021) to run `sandbox-elevator.elf`,
   which opens the filesystem. It does the same later for a game folder or drive that's refused.

Because of step 2, **Wii U games run at full speed even with no app jailbreak at all** — the HEN only
has to open `/data` (or an elfldr has to be listening). This is the key to "works on any config."

---

## The Setup check

On the **first start** — and any time storage or the recompilers fail at start — PS5CEMU-HAR shows a
**Setup check** screen: one row each for storage, recompilers, each side's games and keys, the 3DS's
system files and box art, with a status, what to do, and a QR code that opens the right page of this
guide on your phone. Green rows are ready; amber rows need something; grey rows are optional. You can
always reach the same information later under **Settings > Diagnostics**.

---

## 3. etaHEN (most tested)

1. Load etaHEN (via your firmware's exploit host).
2. Add `PPSA99360` to etaHEN's **app jailbreak list**, and turn on its **app jailbreak** option (in
   etaHEN's advanced or debug settings, depending on the version).
3. Start PS5CEMU-HAR. Diagnostics should say `HEN: ok`, `JIT available (the HEN's)` and
   `/data reachable`.

etaHEN also provides the elfldr on port 9021 that the app uses for drives, so USB games generally
work with no extra steps.

---

## 4. OnionHEN

OnionHEN answers the same jailbreak request as etaHEN, but its allowlist is a line in its
`config.ini`:

1. Open OnionHEN's `config.ini` and find the `[app_jailbreak]` section.
2. Set `enabled=true`. Setting `debug_notifications=true` is worth it too: OnionHEN then shows a
   notification each time it jailbreaks an app, so you can see it worked.
3. Add `PPSA99360` to the **end** of `exact_title_ids`, with **no comma after it**:

   ```ini
   [app_jailbreak]
   enabled=true
   debug_notifications=true
   exact_title_ids=ITEM00001,NPXS39041,PKGI13337,PKGI12345,TOOL00001,PPSA99360
   ```

   OnionHEN drops the **whole list** if any entry is empty or isn't exactly 9 capital letters and
   digits. A trailing comma (`...,PPSA99360,`), a space-only entry or a lowercase ID all count, and
   then no app is jailbroken
   ([#12](https://github.com/premohq/PS5CEMU-HAR/issues/12)). It allows 20 entries at most.
4. Reload OnionHEN (or restart the console and load it again), so it reads the new list.
5. Start PS5CEMU-HAR. With the debug notifications on, OnionHEN says it jailbroke the app.
   Diagnostics should say `HEN: ok` and `/data reachable`.

---

## 5. Kstuff, GoldHEN, or any other HEN with no app jailbreak

Some setups (Kstuff on its own, a HEN without an app-jailbreak allowlist, or a plain exploit host
that only loads payloads) never answer the `/download0/etahen_jailbreak` request. PS5CEMU-HAR still
runs — it looks after itself:

1. Load your HEN/exploit and make sure an **ELF loader is listening on port 9021** (elfldr; the
   etaHEN and OnionHEN payloads include one, and most exploit hosts can load `elfldr.elf`).
2. Start PS5CEMU-HAR. It runs its bundled `sandbox-elevator.elf` through elfldr to open `/data`, and
   the recompilers use executable direct memory.
3. Diagnostics should say `JIT available (executable direct memory, no HEN needed)` and
   `/data reachable`. `HEN: no` here is **expected and fine** — it just means no HEN answered the
   app-jailbreak request; the app got everything it needs another way.

If no ELF loader is running, the app can't reach `/data` and says so at start: load one (or add
`PPSA99360` to a HEN's allowlist), then start the app again.

> **Note on the port.** The elevation helper connects to elfldr on the standard **port 9021**, which
> etaHEN, OnionHEN and the common `elfldr.elf` payload all use. If your loader listens on a different
> port, point it at 9021 (or run the standard elfldr alongside it).

---

## 6. Games on USB or extended storage

Some HENs open `/data` but not the drives (seen on 13.x,
[#16](https://github.com/premohq/PS5CEMU-HAR/issues/16)). When a game folder or a plugged-in drive is
refused, the app runs `sandbox-elevator.elf` through elfldr to open it. Diagnostics then says
`... opened by the elevation helper`. This also needs an ELF loader on port 9021. The app checks
`/mnt/usb0`–`/mnt/usb7` and `/mnt/ext0`/`/mnt/ext1` as well as your chosen game folder.

---

## 7. Reading Diagnostics

**Settings > Diagnostics** (and the boot log) opens with four lines: the app and emulator versions,
the firmware, the privilege summary, and where the logs are. The privilege summary decodes like
this:

| Diagnostics says | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Firmware 11.60 (0x...)` | Your console's firmware, as its own settings show it. Almost every bug report needs this. `unknown` means the query failed (rare). |
| `HEN: ok (HEN took the request after N ms ...)` | The HEN jailbroke the app. |
| `HEN: no (no HEN took the request ...)` | No HEN answered: `PPSA99360` isn't in its allowlist (check the comma for OnionHEN), or the HEN has no app jailbreak. The app carries on without one — this is fine if the next two lines are green. |
| `JIT available (the HEN's)` | The recompilers use the HEN's JIT memory. |
| `JIT available (executable direct memory, no HEN needed)` | The recompilers use memory the app made itself: full speed, no HEN needed. |
| `JIT unavailable (interpreter only)` | Neither worked: Wii U games run very slowly. Please report it with your firmware, HEN and `boot.log`. |
| `; no executable direct memory: 3DS games run on Azahar's interpreter` | The HEN gave JIT memory but the kernel refused executable *direct* memory; the 3DS recompiler needs the latter, so 3DS games run slower. Usually seen only with an app jailbreak on certain firmwares. |
| `/data reachable` | All good. |
| `/data unreachable (elevation helper: N)` | Neither the HEN nor elfldr opened `/data`: load an ELF loader on port 9021, or put `PPSA99360` in your HEN's allowlist. |
| `... opened by the elevation helper` | A refused drive or folder was opened by the bundled helper through elfldr. |

---

## 8. Troubleshooting matrix

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| App shows "cannot reach /data" and quits to a notice | No app jailbreak **and** no elfldr on 9021 | Add `PPSA99360` to your HEN's allowlist, or start an ELF loader on port 9021, then relaunch. |
| Diagnostics: `HEN: no` but `/data reachable`, games full speed | No app jailbreak, but elfldr + executable direct memory covered it | Nothing to fix — this is a fully working no-HEN setup. |
| Wii U games are extremely slow; `JIT unavailable (interpreter only)` | Neither JIT nor executable memory was granted | Add `PPSA99360` to the HEN's app-jailbreak list; if that's not possible on your HEN, report it with `boot.log` and your firmware — this is the one case the app can't work around alone. |
| OnionHEN never jailbreaks the app | A trailing comma or a malformed entry voided the **whole** `exact_title_ids` list | Put `PPSA99360` last with **no** trailing comma, all entries exactly 9 chars, ≤ 20 entries; reload OnionHEN. |
| USB / external games "cannot be read" | HEN opened `/data` but not the drives | Make sure elfldr is on 9021; relaunch. Diagnostics should then say the drive was "opened by the elevation helper." |
| Works once, dead after a reboot | The jailbreak is tethered | Re-run your firmware's exploit and reload the HEN after every cold boot, then start the app. |
| App won't appear / won't register on the home screen | HEN didn't jailbreak `PPSA99360`, or the folder is in the wrong place | Copy the folder to `/data/homebrew/PPSA99360` and list `PPSA99360` in your HEN before launching. |
| Everything green but a specific game crashes | Not a firmware/HEN issue | See the [compatibility list](COMPATIBILITY.md) and [report it](#reporting-problems) with logs. |

## 9. Where it's impossible, and what we can do

The project's goal is that **every console that can run homebrew can run PS5CEMU-HAR**. Here is the
honest line between what we can fix and what we can't:

**What the app already does to reach the widest set of consoles** (no change needed from you):

- Runs the recompilers at full speed **without any HEN grant**, by making executable direct memory
  itself — so a plain elfldr setup is enough.
- Opens `/data` through elfldr when the HEN won't, and opens USB/extended drives the same way.
- Falls back to the interpreter rather than refusing to start when even that fails, so a game still
  runs (slowly) on the most locked-down setups.
- Reports firmware, HEN, recompiler memory and `/data` plainly in Diagnostics and the Setup check,
  so a failing setup is diagnosable instead of mysterious.

**What is genuinely out of reach, and why:**

- **Firmware 14.00 and newer.** There is no public exploit, so the console can't run *any* homebrew,
  and the PS5 can't be downgraded. This is a kernel-exploit problem, not an app problem — nothing
  PS5CEMU-HAR could ship would change it. If and when the scene releases an entry point for a newer
  firmware, PS5CEMU-HAR already works on top of whatever HEN that entry point loads; this page will
  be updated with the coverage.
- **The 5.51–6.99 digital-edition gap.** On the exact versions between UMTX's ceiling and Relapse's
  floor, a console without a disc drive may have no public entry point. Same situation: upstream of
  this app.

**What we're still improving** (tracked as issues, help welcome):

- Clearer, earlier messaging when the *only* missing piece is the app-jailbreak grant on a HEN that
  can't provide one, so the interpreter fallback is an informed choice rather than a surprise.
- Widening the drive-elevation probe as new mount points show up on newer firmwares.

If your console runs homebrew but PS5CEMU-HAR doesn't, that's a bug we want — it almost always means
one of the three needs above wasn't met in a way we can handle better. Please
[report it](#reporting-problems).

---

## Reporting problems

Check the [compatibility list](COMPATIBILITY.md) first, then
[open an issue with the bug report form](https://github.com/premohq/PS5CEMU-HAR/issues/new/choose).
It asks for your **firmware, HEN, app version and logs**, which almost every problem needs — all of
them are on the first lines of **Settings > Diagnostics**.

- **Copy logs to USB** (Settings > Diagnostics): puts the logs and settings in a dated
  `PS5CEMU-HAR-logs-...` folder on a USB drive. The app keeps the last five sessions' logs, so copy
  them soon after a problem and attach them to your report.

When you report a problem, say which HEN and version you use, your firmware, and attach those logs.
