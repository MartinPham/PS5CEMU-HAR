# Builds RADV, the PS5's Vulkan driver, in two steps:
#
#  1. PS5_Vulkan's own recipe (its tools/build-radv.sh release): the Mesa fork pinned in deps.json
#     (.deps/PS5_Mesa, the revision PS5_Vulkan pins) into .deps/PS5_Vulkan/.deps/native/radv-release,
#     with the SDK, host tools and cross files it sets up.
#  2. The same revision with the port's driver patches (patches/mesa) that RADV_PATCHES names,
#     configured as the recipe configures its release, into
#     .deps/PS5_Vulkan/.deps/native/radv-ps5cemu, where tools/link.sh finds it:
#
#       RADV_PATCHES=0006       the default: 0006, VideoOut's refresh rate asked for again once the
#                               new launcher's swapchain is gone, without which a game's 120 Hz
#                               output stays at the launcher's 59.94 Hz
#       RADV_PATCHES=0004,0006  those patches, by number, applied in order
#       RADV_PATCHES=all        every patch in patches/mesa (docs/DRIVER-PERFORMANCE.md's A/B runs)
#       RADV_PATCHES=           none: the recipe's archive as it is
#
# The patched tree is made in a temporary index of the fork's repository and exported with git
# archive, as the recipe exports its revision: the fork's working tree and branches are not touched.
# The build id stays the pinned revision while the patches touch only the winsys and WSI, which
# keeps the games' shader caches; a patch elsewhere gets the patched tree's id, so caches start over.
#
# RADV's PS5 winsys is built on the payload SDK fork's platform layer (ps5platform/ and
# libps5platform.a: direct memory, AGC, VideoOut, the heap and libc's gaps), which the public SDK
# does not have: Mihawk-99's PS5_PayloadSDK, pinned in deps.json (.deps/PS5_PayloadSDK).
# PS5_PAYLOAD_SDK_FORK names another checkout that has the revision PS5_Vulkan's
# tools/setup-native-dependencies.sh pins.
#
# Host tools, as PS5_Vulkan's recipe needs them: meson, mako and Python's packaging (Mesa checks
# mako's version with it), ninja, rsync, glslangValidator (glslang-tools: RADV's BVH shaders), and
# for Mesa's OpenCL kernels LLVM, Clang, libclc and the SPIR-V LLVM translator (on Ubuntu:
# llvm-18-dev, libclang-18-dev, libclc-18-dev, libllvmspirvlib-18-dev, llvm-spirv-18).
#
# A RADV built elsewhere can be used instead: RADV_ARCHIVE (libvulkan_radeon.ps5.a) and RADV_SDK
# (the fork's SDK it was built with) name it to tools/link.sh.
